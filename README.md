# Most important
- pay attention to those issues labeled with "HelpWanted" and "Urgent and Important"

# Terminology
- **open-box, lock-box and curator-box**: openbox is data you can use as you want for training, lock-box is left over independent dataset for testing,  curator-box is the data you can send your model to it to query how good it is but can not carry out training on it. 


# about running
- basic test: source bt_test_geo.R before submit your code
- advanced test: oml: source bt_test_oml.R 

# potential bug
- if error like ("not a matrix") in Kriging occur, that means mbo always see a constant value

# cluster
- pay attention to R/batchtools.conf.R, the budgets are set there. Test how long it needs locally (> 8 hours) first
- first submit only 10 replications according to getJobTable()[, repl], then submit the rest replications.

# Runing on lido cluster in Dortmund
- delete the batchtools.conf.R file since that file is for lrz
